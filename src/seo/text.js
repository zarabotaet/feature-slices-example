As an event organiser, think carefully about the space you have available at your venue and the number of guests you are expecting.  Think about the type of event you want to create – is it a formal dining event or a more relaxed networking and social event?  The type of furniture you need for each of these events is vastly different.  Always try to plan and hire furniture as far in advance as possible to ensure that you don’t miss out.  Remember, you’re not the only event professional organising the next party, corporate lunch or awards ceremony!  The best furniture hire companies are constantly in demand and the best furniture products always get hired well in advance!  This is especially true for outdoor summer events, with patio and garden furniture such as picnic benches and outdoor café table and chair sets being in huge demand in the peak of summer, so get your order in early!`,

          `Almost any and every event will need glassware of some description, whether it is champagne and prosecco glasses to toast the bride and groom at a wedding or to celebrate the recent success of a company, or wine glasses for smart hospitality table settings, the diversity of events for which glassware is required is huge.  But what are you looking for in your glassware hire supplier?  Range? Quality? Quantity?  Price?  The reality is that all these are important factors to consider when deciding which company to rent glasses from.`,

          `Firstly, the range.  It’s certainly true to say that not all events are the same.It stands to reason, therefore, that the type of glasses required for events definitely varies.  That’s why here at easyEventhire you will find a wide range of different ranges at different price points to cater for all events.  From basic glassware ranges through to more high-end ranges, the team here at easyEventhire are ready to assist you, whatever your requirements.`,
          `Secondly, the quality.  The very last thing you want when you hire glasses for events is for the glasses to arrive either not matching, incomplete in number or, worse still, dirty. There’s really nothing worse than being served a drink in a stained or dirty glass.  That’s why the best event hire companies will have strict internal quality controls to ensure that their product offering is right first time.  For glassware, this comes down the glasses being machine washed, thoroughly checked and counted in between hires.  By doing this here at easyEventhire, you can rest assured that your rental glasses will arrive with you table ready, and ready for instant use at your event.  Thirdly, with regards to quantities, again the best event rental companies will be able to offer all the various types of glasses on offer in thousands – after all, large scale event dining occasions call for thousands of wine glasses and champagne flutes all in the same design, especially for corporate dining and Christmas parties at large arenas and iconic destinations, for example. `,
          `And finally the price – of course, you get what you pay for, like anything else.  Is cheap glassware hire the best way to go?  We would say not, as you want to make sure that your supplier is going to turn up on time, with the glasses you need, in the quantities you need and in the quality you need.  You won’t necessarily get this peace of mind by simply hiring from the cheapest supplier.  Here at easyEventhire, our prices are highly competitive and we believe that for the quality of product and service we provide, our prices can’t be beaten!  Hire event glassware today online with the experts at easyEventhire – we look forward to working with you.`,

Up until now, there have been obvious issues with the fact that at large events such as festivals, concerts, sports stadiums and other venues, there is a need to serve large volumes of people with drinks, but this has to be done in a safe manner, and so single use plastic cups have been the solution.`,

          `However, single use plastics, whilst they do enable event organisers to comply with H&S regulations in so much as that they are non-glass, they do not help the environment.  With the best will in the world, it’s almost impossible to ensure that every single use plastic pint cup used at your event will reach the recycling plant and, therefore, they become exactly that – single use plastic which ultimately ends up in landfill or, even worse still, in the ocean.  Either way, single use plastic is not a sustainable option.  That’s why our range of reusable plastic cups here at easyEventhire is one of our most exciting offerings.  In here, you will find ranges such as Stack-Cup™ which has a unique stacking handle facility, enabling users to carry multiple pints at any one time as well as our other reusable and recyclable cup options.`,
